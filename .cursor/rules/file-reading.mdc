# Complete File Reading

## Fundamental Principle

**ALWAYS read complete files, from start to finish, before making analyses, corrections or implementations**. Partial analyses can miss important problems, hidden references, or critical context.

## Mandatory Rule

### Complete Reading Before Any Action

- **NEVER make analyses based on partial reading** of files
- **NEVER make corrections based on partial reading** of files
- **NEVER make implementations based on partial reading** of files
- **ALWAYS read the complete file** (from start to finish, until EOF) before:
  - Analyzing code
  - Reviewing code
  - Correcting code
  - Implementing changes
  - Identifying unused fields
  - Mapping functionalities
  - Any other action that depends on code understanding

## Process for Large Files

When a file is too large for a single reading call:
1. **Read in multiple sequential calls** until EOF
2. **Maintain complete context** of all read parts
3. **Only after reading the complete file**, start analysis/correction/implementation
4. **NEVER** start corrections after reading only part of the file

## Why This Is Important

### Unused Field Identification

- Fields can be referenced anywhere in the file
- Partial analysis can miss important references
- Only possible to guarantee a field is unused after reading the complete file

### Context and Dependencies

- Imports, classes, functions can be anywhere in the file
- Relationships and dependencies may not be visible in partial reading
- Complete flow understanding requires complete reading

### Safe Corrections

- Corrections based on partial analysis can break unanalyzed code
- Changes can affect unread parts of the file
- Only safe to correct after understanding the entire file

## Exceptions

**No exceptions**: this rule applies to all analysis, correction or implementation situations.
