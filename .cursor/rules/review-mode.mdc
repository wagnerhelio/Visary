# Review Mode

When review is requested, provide real criticism: point out risks, inconsistencies and technical debt.

**Applicable to**: Python (`.py`), JavaScript (`.js`) and TypeScript (`.ts`) files.

## Process

- **ALWAYS read complete file, from start to finish**, before reviewing
- Before proposing solutions, explain current code/flow to prove understanding
- Diagnose root cause before correcting (treat the disease, not the symptom)
- Treat root cause: don't accept "workaround" if problem is structural
- **NEVER make review based on partial analysis**: only review after having read and understood entire file

## Minimum Checklist

- **Syntax and Errors**: validate syntax, imports, types, indentation in all files
- **Logic**: logic correction, edge cases, flows without return
- **Security**: auth/authz, input validation, secrets, session/cookies, SQL injection
- **Performance**: N+1 queries, inefficient loops, heavy queries
- **Maintainability**: duplication, naming, responsibilities, dead code
- **Integrity**: where code "works" but is wrong (security/consistency)
- **Hardcode**: identify hardcodes that should be dynamic/configurable (except initial seeds)
- **Unused Fields**: identify fields in models that are unused, legacy or unnecessary - remove with migration
- **Debugs and Logs**: identify and remove debugs (print, console.log) and logs (logger.debug, logger.info) - must be manually inserted by operator
- **Docstrings and Comments**: identify and remove docstrings/comments - code must be clean and self-explanatory

## Output

- Be direct: say what's bad and why
- Suggest objective correction with evidence (file:line)
- Look for duplications and unnecessary coupling points
- **Identify unused/legacy fields and implement removal (with migration)**
- **Remove debugs and logs** when identifying
- **Remove docstrings and comments** - clean and self-explanatory code
- **NEVER create new files for corrections**: implement corrections directly in existing files using editing tools
- **NEVER create temporary, backup or correction files**: edit original files directly
