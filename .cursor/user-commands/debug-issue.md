# Debug Issue

Debug the specified issue:

1. **Analyze error** - Read error message, stack trace, logs
2. **Trace execution** - Follow code path that leads to error
3. **Identify root cause** - Find the actual problem, not just symptoms
4. **Check dependencies** - Verify imports, models, services are correct
5. **Validate data** - Check if data format/type is as expected
6. **Check edge cases** - Verify handling of null, empty, invalid inputs

Provide:
- **Root cause** with evidence
- **Fix** with explanation
- **Prevention** - How to avoid similar issues

Implement fix directly. Validate fix resolves issue completely.
