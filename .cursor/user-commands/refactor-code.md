# Refactor Code

Refactor code to improve:
- Structure and organization
- Readability and maintainability
- Code duplication (DRY principle)
- Naming conventions
- Separation of concerns

Before refactoring:
- Read complete file(s) first
- Understand all dependencies
- Ensure tests exist or create them
- Validate after refactoring

Refactor incrementally. Maintain original functionality. Validate with tests.
