# Optimize Performance

Analyze and optimize code performance:

1. **Database queries** - Check for N+1 problems, missing indexes, inefficient queries
2. **Loops and iterations** - Identify O(n²) or worse, suggest optimizations
3. **Algorithm efficiency** - Analyze time/space complexity
4. **Caching opportunities** - Identify data that can be cached
5. **Lazy loading** - Check if eager loading can be optimized
6. **Memory usage** - Identify memory leaks, large object retention

Before optimizing:
- ALWAYS consult Context7 (MCP) for framework-specific optimization patterns
- ALWAYS search internet for current best practices

Provide concrete evidence of performance issues with measurements when possible.
Implement optimizations directly. Validate performance improvements.
